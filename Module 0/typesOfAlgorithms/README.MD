**Sorting Algorithms**:
- **Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, "bubbling" the largest values to the end of the list.
- **Insertion Sort**: An algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time, inserting each element into its proper position within the already sorted part of the array.

**Search Algorithms**:
- **Linear Search**: A simple search algorithm that iterates through a list to find a target element by comparing each element sequentially.
- **Binary Search**: An efficient search algorithm for sorted lists. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half until the target element is found.

**Graph Traversal**:
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: A graph traversal algorithm that explores all vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, visiting all the vertices at the same level before moving to the next level.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: A graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, visiting vertices in depth-first order.

**Dynamic Programming**:
- Dynamic Programming is a technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once, storing the results for future reference. It often involves the use of memoization or bottom-up tabulation.

**Divide and Conquer**:
- **Merge Sort**: A sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It recursively divides the input list into two halves, sorts them independently, and then merges the two sorted halves to produce the final sorted list.

**Recursion**:
- Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems. Recursion typically involves a base case to terminate the recursion and recursive calls to solve smaller subproblems.

These are foundational concepts and algorithms used in computer science and programming. Each topic has its own intricacies and applications, and diving deeper into them can provide a deeper understanding of algorithmic problem-solving and efficient program design.
