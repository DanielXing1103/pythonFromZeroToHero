In Python, data structures can be classified into two main categories: primitive data structures and non-primitive data structures.



**Primitive Data Structures**:

1.  **Integers**: Represent whole numbers, such as 1, 10, -5, etc.

2.  **Floats**: Represent decimal numbers, such as 3.14, -0.5, etc.

3.  **Booleans**: Represent either `True` or `False` values, used for logical operations.

4.  **Strings**: Represent sequences of characters, enclosed in single quotes or double quotes, like `'hello'`, `"world"`, etc.

  

**Non-Primitive Data Structures ** buit-in are in bold:

  **Linear**:

1.  **Lists**: Ordered collections of items, enclosed in square brackets, allowing duplicates and mutable operations like appending, removing, and modifying elements.
2.  **Tuples**: Ordered collections of items, enclosed in parentheses, allowing duplicates but immutable (cannot be modified once created).
3. Array
4. Linked-list
5. Stack: FILO
6. Queue: FIFO

**Non linear**:
7.  **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique items, enclosed in curly braces or created using the `set()` constructor.
8.  **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces, where each element consists of a key and its associated value.
9. Trees
10.Graphs

  
These data structures provide different ways to store, organize, and manipulate data in Python. Choosing the appropriate data structure depends on the specific requirements of your program and the operations you need to perform on the data.
